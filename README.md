# Autoencoders for Morse Graphs
This package implements autoencoders for high-dimensional dynamical systems. It also provides utilities for using the autoencoders to construct a Morse Graph in the learned latent space.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/aravindsiv/AEMG.git
cd AEMG
pip install -e .
```

## Usage
The `examples` directory contains an example of how to collect data and train an autoencoder for a pendulum system defined in ML4KP.
